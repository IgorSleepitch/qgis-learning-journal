# 2. Module: Creating and Exploring a Basic Map

**Goal:** Get familiar with the QGIS interface, load base maps, and understand the concept of layers and symbols.

### Steps
1. Installed QGIS (v3.40 LTR) and explored the main panels.
2. Added a basemap using the QuickMapServices plugin.
3. Imported sample vector datasets from diff databases.
4. Styled layers with basic symbology and added labels.
5. Created custom symbols.
6. Used masking.

### Outcome
- Learned how QGIS organizes spatial data by layer type.
- Understood CRS basics.
- Created my first simple map.

### Reflection
Working in QGIS feels partly intuitive after Photoshop and Premiere. However, interface and some mechanics felt quite outdated.
