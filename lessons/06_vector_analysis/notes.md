# 6. Module: Vector Analysis

**Goal:** Learn how to reproject, analyze spatial relationships, calculate distances and areas, and apply basic network and spatial statistics tools.

### Steps
1. Explored **projections and CRS** — reprojected layers and saved them in new CRS formats.  
2. Practiced **on-the-fly reprojection** and created a **custom projection** for localized analysis.  
3. Did **spatial queries** — measuring distances between features (e.g., schools and roads).  
4. Used **buffer, intersection, and selection tools** to identify buildings within defined proximity zones.  
5. Conducted **network analysis** — calculated the shortest and fastest routes between points using the Road Graph plugin.  
6. Created **service area maps** to visualize accessibility around points of interest.  
7. Experimented with **spatial statistics**: nearest neighbor analysis, mean center, and spatial interpolation.

### Outcome
- Understood the importance of CRS and how it affects analysis accuracy.  
- Built multi-step workflows combining vector and spatial tools.  
- Created meaningful outputs such as distance maps, route maps, and density visualizations.  
- Saved the final project results.

### Reflection
This module felt like finally beginning exploring the analytical power of GIS — maps became more than visuals, they started answering questions.  
It’s rewarding to see data relationships emerge through spatial analysis, especially when results reflect real-world patterns.
