# 7. Module: Rasters

**Goal:** Understand how to visualize, transform, and analyze raster data for terrain and surface modelling.

### Steps
1. Loaded multiple **raster layers** (DEM and land cover) and combined them into a **Virtual Raster (VRT)** mosaic.  
2. Practiced **reprojecting and transforming rasters** to match project CRS.
3. Adjusted **raster symbology** — singleband gray, pseudocolor, and transparency settings for better visual interpretation.  
4. Generated **hillshade** from DEM data to analyze terrain morphology.
5. Calculated **aspect** and combined multiple raster layers to locate ideal terrain conditions (e.g., north-facing slopes with specific inclination). 
6. Performed **raster reclassification** to simplify continuous data into categorical classes. 
7. Used **raster calculator** and queries to combine analytical criteria into a final suitability map.

### Outcome
- Learned key raster visualization and transformation techniques.  
- Created analytical maps: hillshade, slope, aspect, and suitability layers.  
- Understood how raster math and reclassification work in spatial analysis.  
- Exported final visualizations as `raster_analysis_results.png`.

### Reflection
Raster analysis revealed the elevation and light dynamics behind the map — a glimpse into the “hidden structure” of the landscape.  
It’s fascinating how adjusting colors, slopes, and lighting transforms flat data into something readable as 3D space.
