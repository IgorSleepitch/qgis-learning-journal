# 5. Module: Creating Vector Data

**Goal:** Learn how to create and edit vector datasets from scratch, ensure clean toplogy, and use forms and actions to enhance data entry.

### Steps
1. Created **new vector layers** manualy using the Layer Creation dialog.  
2. Defined **geometry types** (points, lines, polygons) and set up attribute fields.  
3. Practiced **digitizing** polygons and lines using snapping and vertex editing tools.  
4. Explored **topology rules** to prevent geometry errors — gaps, overlaps, and dangling lines.  
5. Used **Simplify**, **Reshape**, **Split**, and **Merge Features** tools for editing geometries.  
6. Designed **custom forms** to simplify attribute data entry and set field types.  
7. Created **layer actions** to open images or webpages directly from attribute data.  

### Outcome
- Learned to build a clean vector dataset entirely from scratch.  
- Understood the importance of topological accuracy in editing workflows.  
- Created functional forms for faster and more reliable data input.  
- Linked spatial features to external resources through QGIS Actions.  
- Saved the final layer as `custom_vector_dataset.gpkg`.

### Reflection
Digitizing data by hand feels like “drawing knowledge onto the map”.  
This module connected the creative and technical sides of GIS — turning real-world features into editable, structured data
