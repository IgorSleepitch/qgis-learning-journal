# Lesson 08 — Completing the Analysis

**Goal:** Bring together vector and raster workflows into a complete GIS analysis project.

**Steps**
1. Reviewed all project data (vector + raster) and ensured consistent CRS alignment across layers.  
2. Cleaned vector datasets using topology tools:
   - removed duplicates and slivers  
   - corrected misaligned boundaries  
   - verified feature geometry  

3. Integrated raster and vector data by extracting values from rasters to vector layers and using them as criteria for final analysis.

4. Built a multi-step spatial model:
   - buffered sensitive zones  
   - intersected areas of interest  
   - applied raster-based suitability masks  
   - combined results into a single polygon output  

5. Prepared final map outputs:
   - consistent symbology  
   - exported as high-resolution PDF

**Outcome**
- Produced a complete, traceable GIS analysis workflow.  
- Learned how to merge vector logic, raster calculations, and model automation into a cohesive project.  
- Created final deliverables suitable for presentation or reporting.

### Reflection
This module felt like the moment when separate GIS tools “clicked together.”  
It highlighted the value of a clean data structure, clear criteria, and repeatable modeling — the foundations of real-world analytical GIS work.
