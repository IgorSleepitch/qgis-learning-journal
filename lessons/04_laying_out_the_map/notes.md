# 4. Module — Laying Out the Maps

**Goal:** Learn how to design, customize, and export professional map layouts for production or further development.

### Steps
1. Opened the **Layout Manager** and created a new print layout project.  
2. Added a **map frame**, adjusted its extent, and fine-tuned scale and positioning.  
3. Added **map elements** title, legend, north arrow, and scale bar.  
4. Customized legend items for clarity and removed unnecessary layers.  
5. Practiced **dynamic elements**: map titles, headers, and labels that update automatically.    
6. Exported final layouts as **PDF** for sharing and printing.

### Outcome
- Learned to create print-ready maps with consistent visual design.  
- Understood layout composition principles: balance, hierarchy, and readability.  
- Created a dynamic layout with automatic map title and legend updates.  
- Exported the final product as `dynamic_layout.png`.

### Reflection
Designing a map layout feels like the creative reward for all the data preparation — it’s where analysis turns into storytelling.  
Seeing an export-ready map feels like finishing a small artwork from when I used to do digital illustrations.
