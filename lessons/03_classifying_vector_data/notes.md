# Module 3. Classifying Vector Data

**Goal:** Learn how to explore vector attribute data, label map features, and classify spatial information to make maps more informative and visually meaningful.

### Steps
1. Opened vector layers and examined their **attribute tables** to understand how non-spatial data connects to geometry.  
2. Used **Select by Expression** and **Field Calculator** to filter and modify attribute data.  
3. Added **labels** based on attribute fields and customized their appearance (font, color, placement).  
4. Experimented with **data-defined labeling** to make text adapt to feature properties.  
5. Applied **categorical and numerical classification** using color schemes and symbology.  
6. Tried **rule-based classification** for advanced map styling.

### Outcome
- Gained confidence working with attribute tables and expressions.  
- Understood how labeling and classification enhance map readability.  
- Saved the best results as `basic_map.qgz`.

### Conclusion
This lesson showed how data becomes storytelling — attributes add meaning, and symbology gives it a visual language.  
It’s exciting to see how design choices can completely change how a map communicates information.
