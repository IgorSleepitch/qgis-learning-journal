In this training excercise I was tasked with finding areas in and around the Cape Peninsula that are suitable habitats for a rare fynbos plant species. 
The extent of area of investigation covered Cape Town and the Cape Peninsula between Melkbosstrand in the north and Strand in the south. 
Botanists have provided following preferences exhibited by the species in question:

- It grows on east facing slopes
- It grows on slopes with a gradient between 15% and 60%
- It grows in areas that have a total annual rainfall of > 1000 mm
- It will only be found at least 250m away from any human settlement
- The area of vegetation in which it occurs should be at least 6000 ㎡ in area

As a student at the University, I agreed to search for the plant in four different suitable areas of land. 
Those four suitable areas were to be the ones that are closest to the University of Cape Town.
So I had to use my existing GIS skills to determine where I should go to look.

Like in the real esate task, I had to make a full analysis using vector and raster data:

- Analyzing a DEM raster layer to find the east facing slopes and the slopes with the correct gradients
- Analyzing a rainfall raster layer to find the areas with the correct amount of rainfall
- Analyzing a zoning vector layer to find areas that are away from human settlement and are of the correct size

As a result, I've layed out an area map, showing the UCT campus and 4 closest to it plots of fynbos bush growing area.
