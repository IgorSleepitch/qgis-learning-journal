# QGIS Learning Journal

Welcome to my QGIS Learning Journal — a record of my path into the world of GIS, mapping, and spatial data analysis.  
I’m a mechanical engineer by education, proffessional automotive restorer and video editor by background and lately I've decided to transition into GIS as since childhood I've been fascinated by maps, geography, and been a passionate traveler, terrain lurker.
This repository documents my hands-on learning process through the Official QGIS Training Manual, OSM contributions, JOSM and other resources.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `lessons/` | My completed exercises from the QGIS Training Manual |
| `reflections/` | Weekly thoughts on what I’ve learned and how it connects to real world GIS work |

## Learning Goals

- Build a solid foundation in QGIS (vector, raster, symbology, layout workflows)  
- Learn to collect, clean, and visualize spatial datasets  
- Practice geoprocessing tools  
- Create my own maps and analyses for a future GIS portfolio  
- Move toward automation with Python (GeoPandas, Folium) and spatial SQL

## Progress Snapshot

| Lesson | Preview | Topic |
|--------|----------|--------|

## Upcoming Additions

- Add screenshots and notes from each QGIS exercise  
- Create my first independent project  
- Learn to share maps interactively (Leaflet, Mapbox, or GitHub Pages)
