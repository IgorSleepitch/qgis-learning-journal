Before Module 5 I've already been contributing to OSM for some months already, thus I was familiar with creating feaures on the map and attributing them.
Nevertheless, I learned that QGIS offers huge amount of instruments from customizing symbology to action calling. For instance, I had fun attaching a web link to a feature,
so that info from net shows up directly in QGIS.
