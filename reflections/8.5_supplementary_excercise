This one excercise was fully focused on step-by-step completing a certain task using knowledge I got to the moment.
I developed undersanding of how large the steps are - how much average time they shall take up, as if I was already working in a pipeline.
Also, it shared an idea of implementing GIS skills in a routine research or exploring unfamiliar territories.
All in all, I'm quite excited to get to this point.
