So, finally the educational task is complete - now I have idea of how a real task 
(find a plot on a <2 or <5 degree slope facing north in Swellendam town within 1000m from school, 500m from restaurant, 50m from main roads) can look like.
Working in QGIS I also realized a difference from PhotoShop, which comes in very handy - you can combine layers from different projects if they corrspond in parameters.
